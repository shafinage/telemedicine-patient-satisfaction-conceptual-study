# Conceptual Research Paper  
## Patient Satisfaction and Preference for Telemedicine in Malaysia

This repository presents a **conceptual research study** that synthesizes existing literature on telemedicine usage, patient satisfaction, and future adoption intention, with a focus on the Malaysian healthcare context. The study applies structured evidence synthesis to identify key determinants and develop a conceptual framework for future empirical research.

## Research Background
Telemedicine adoption increased rapidly during the COVID-19 pandemic due to movement restrictions and healthcare system strain. While patient satisfaction during the pandemic was generally high, questions remain regarding **continued usage and preference post-pandemic**, particularly in countries where telemedicine adoption is relatively recent, such as Malaysia.

---

## Research Objective
The objectives of this study are to:
- Identify the most frequently studied factors influencing patient satisfaction and preference for telemedicine
- Synthesize findings from prior empirical studies
- Develop a conceptual framework and hypotheses to guide future quantitative research in Malaysia

---

## Methodology Overview
A structured literature review and evidence synthesis approach was applied.

- **Databases:** PubMed, Elsevier, JAMA, ResearchGate, Google Scholar  
- **Keywords:** telemedicine, patient satisfaction, preference, perception, COVID-19  
- **Time frame:** 2017–2022  
- **Initial articles screened:** 24  
- **Final articles included:** 19  

Each study was systematically extracted and tabulated to identify:
- Dependent, independent, moderating, and mediating variables  
- Research methods and analytical approaches  
- Key findings and limitations  

---

## Evidence Synthesis Approach
A literature matrix was developed to organize and analyze extracted variables. Variables were:
- Categorized by role (dependent, independent, moderator)
- Counted using frequency analysis
- Selected based on repeated occurrence across studies

Variables appearing in **four or more studies** were considered significant for framework development.

---

## Key Findings
The synthesis identified **six dominant factors** influencing patient satisfaction and preference for telemedicine:

- Technological aspects  
- Accessibility  
- Perceived usefulness  
- Service quality  
- Similarity to face-to-face interaction  
- Convenience  

Patient satisfaction was found to **moderate the relationship** between these factors and patient preference.

---

## Conceptual Framework Development
Based on the synthesized evidence, a conceptual framework was developed to illustrate:
- Direct effects of identified factors on patient satisfaction
- The moderating role of satisfaction on future preference
- Hypothesis pathways for empirical testing

This framework integrates established theories such as:
- Technology Acceptance Model (TAM)  
- Expectation Disconfirmation Theory (EDT)  
- Telehealth Usability Questionnaire (TUQ)  
- SERVQUAL model  

---

## Research Contribution
This study contributes by:
- Structuring fragmented telemedicine literature into a coherent framework
- Highlighting gaps in Malaysia-specific telemedicine research
- Providing a foundation for future empirical studies on post-pandemic telemedicine adoption
